This is the repo for our ITS assignment on DBD

Some rules to make everyone's lives easier:

1) Use Arial font only
2) Font size for main text is 12pt
3) Line spacing is 1.5
4) Please do not forget to reference everything you use. Make sure to use Word's built in referencing system when referencing so that the document stays neat. 
   If you don't know how to do this, follow this YT vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4srwwHGWzg. We are using the Harvard referencing style.
